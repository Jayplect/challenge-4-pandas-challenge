## Desciption
The purpose of this project was to analyze my city's school district in order to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. To achive this, I created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze the school and standardized test data.

## Summary of Dataset
You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
I then generated all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study as well as provided a top-level summary of the study results.
There are two sets of data are used for this project. One of the the datasets shows the student details including grades while the other data set houses the schools and budget information. The data used in this analysis were simulated for the purpose of this project.
## Project Steps
### Step 1: Merging both data sets 
The first step following series of other steps was to load both data sets and then using a left join from pandas merge both data sets on school name. 

  Load files using path from pathlib
  
    school_data_to_load = Path("Resources/schools_complete.csv")
    student_data_to_load = Path("Resources/students_complete.csv")

  Read School and Student Data File and store into Pandas DataFrames 
  
    school_data = pd.read_csv(school_data_to_load)
    student_data = pd.read_csv(student_data_to_load)

  Combine the data into a single dataset
  
    school_data_complete = pd.merge(student_data, school_data, how="left", on=["school_name", "school_name"])
